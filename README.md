Hello All!

Listed here are some of the trading algorithms, Quantitative Tradng Club (Q.T.C.) has worked on. All of the programs are written in python through QuantConnect's API. 

Additionally, as we sourced some of the algorithms from QuantConnect's library we have indicated the level of originality at the beginning of each folder.

Within the repository, we have Framework_Algorithms which include Universe, Alpha, Portfolio Construction, Risk Management, Execution Modules that have been either created by Q.T.C. or sourced from QuantConnect.

We also included three classic algorithms, a Keras Neural Network, Custom Portfolio Optimizer and Using the Majority party of the Senate to predict Gun stocks.  

We are looking forward to continually grow our repo of trading algorithms and if you have any questions please reach out to us at qtcuic@gmail.com or at our LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantitative-trading-club/?viewAsMember=true
